## Homework 7 (due Saturday, March 16, 2019, 11:59pm)

You will be submitting each homework assignment into a new GitHub repository each week. [Here are instructions on how to do so.](https://github.com/zamfi/github-guide/blob/master/README.md) Please email me if you have any questions.

### Music and Motion Midterm Mini-Project

Your homework this week is to finish your midterm Music and Motion
Mini-Project.  You will be presenting your project to the class next week for
critique.

The final version of your program must be committed to GitHub before the due
date.  Along with your code, be sure to also upload any MP3 or other sound
files your program uses.  If you used the online editor to work on your project,
in the README file, also include a link to your project at editor.p5js.org.

If you used someone else's code as a starting point for your project (such as
of the examples on the P5 website, or one of the sample programs I provided for
inspiration), that work must be credited in comments at the top of your file
along with a link to where the original work can be found.  Here's an example:

```javascript
// This program started our as modifications to the P5 Springs example program,
// which I downloaded from https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-springs.html
```
