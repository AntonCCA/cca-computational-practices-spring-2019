## Homework 9

### API review

To solidify the API concepts we talked about in class, make a copy of the [weather.js](../sketches/weather.js) example program and modify it to run on your computer.  To do so, you'll need to register for a free account at [aerisweather.com](http://aerisweather.com).  Once you have an account, edit the program to replace the `ID` and `SECRET` that aerisweather.com assigned you.

Daniel Shiffman has a few vidoes about APIs and JSON, if you need a refresher. The first video in the series [starts here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJaXOFfwGVw).

When you're exploring APIs and looking at JSON data in your browser, you might find it handy to install the [Chrome JSON Viewer extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh), which pretty-prints JSON data structures to make it easier for humans to read.

There are *tons* of public APIs out there -- and a bunch of websites that collect lists of them.  Here are a few of those lists to give you a sense of what's available:

- [https://any-api.com/](https://any-api.com/)
- [https://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory](https://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory)
- [https://www.data.gov/developers/apis](https://www.data.gov/developers/apis)

### HTML and CSS review

You can find copies of the HTML and CSS files we went over in class in the [html-fun](../html-fun/) directory of the class repository.  If you'd like to explore more HTML and CSS, have a look at the [html-css-miniworkshop.md](../html-fun/html-css-miniworkshop.md) file.

### Final Project

Next week's homework will include submitting three ideas for your final project.  Start thinking now about what you might want to propose.
