## Homework 10 (due Sunday, April 14, 2019, 11:59pm)

### Final Project Proposals

For this week's homework, submit at least two, but no more than three proposals with ideas for your final project.  We'll go over them one-on-one in class on Monday to talk about which proposal might work best, and discuss if the scope  is complex enough, but still practical for the amount of time you have.

Create a repository in your GitHub account named `week10`, and upload three files named `proposal.md`, `proposal2.md`, and `proposal3.md`.  For each proposal, use [this template](../final-project-template.md) to describe your project and outline the steps you'll need to take to achieve it.

We have three class sessions together for you to work on your final project (April 15, April 22, April 29) before you present your project to the class for critique (May 6).
